# Negotiation project
For the final project in Baylor's Negotiation and Conflict Management class, we must demonstrate the knowledge we've learned in a creative way.

# Guidelines
- Create a reminder to help you continue improving your negotiating and conflict resolution skills in the future
- Think visually, graphically, and creatively
- Should include at least 5 course concepts or take-aways
- Should be (mostly) your own design and language (limit your use of Google image search)
- Will be graded on Effort, Creativity, and Usefulness as a memory device

# Other notes
The creative synthesis project is worth 15 points and is due by Wednesday, April 27th at 1:00pm. If your project cannot be uploaded, you can bring it to class on the day it is due.
